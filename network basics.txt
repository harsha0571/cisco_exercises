router : 
 -network layer 3 (network)
 -wifi and ethernet
 -single network distributes the ip 
 -A router works by connecting a network to another network via a modem.
 The router will normally be found at the gateway to the network and perform 
 the function of routing or passing on data packets along the network. 
 Since data packets contain the destination IP addresses of where they are 
 headed, this enables routers and modems to communicate with each other using 
 ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to determine the most efficient path 
 for transmitting data packets over the network to their destination point. 

switch: 
 -layer 2 (data link)
 -ethernet only
 -merges multiple networks
 -While switches don't have inherent network protection built in, a router will 
 -often have hardware-based firewall protection that is individually configurable 
 -to your individual office or home network to give optimum connectivity.
 -While a network switch can connect multiple devices and networks to expand the LAN, 
  a router will allow you to share a single IP address among multiple network devices. 
  In simpler terms, the Ethernet switch creates networks and the router allows for 
  connections between networks. 


wireless controller(WLAN):
 - physical and data link layer
 
 -Access point:
  An access point is the device that allows multiple wireless devices to connect with each other. 
  Just like a HUB or switch connects multiple devices together in a single or multiple wired LAN networks, 
  an access point connects multiple wireless devices together in a single wireless or multiple wireless networks. 
  An access point can also be used to extend the wired network to the wireless devices.

 -A controlled access point works as the client of the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). 
  Technically a controlled access point is known as the Lightweight Access Point (LWAP). 
  LWAP doesn’t take any forwarding decision. Upon receiving a frame from the connected device, 
  instead of forwarding it to the destination device, it forwards that frame to the WLC. The WLC, 
  based on the security configuration, makes decision whether the received frame should be forwarded
  or discarded. If the frame needs to be forwarded, then it sends that frame to that LWAP, to which 
  the destination device is connected. Then that LWAP sends this frame to the destination device.

vlan:

 - A VLAN (virtual LAN) is a subnetwork which can group together collections of devices on separate physical 
   local area networks (LANs).
 - VLANs make it easy for network administrators to partition a single switched network to match the functional 
   and security requirements of their systems without having to run new cables or make major changes in their 
   current network infrastructure.
 - VLANs are also important because they can help improve the overall performance of a network by grouping together 
   devices that communicate most frequently. VLANs also provide security on larger networks by allowing a higher 
   degree of control over which devices have access to each other. 
 - How VLAN works:
     Ports (interfaces) on switches can be assigned to one or more VLANs, enabling systems to be divided into logical 
     groups -- based on which department they are associated with -- and establish rules about how systems in the 
     separate groups are allowed to communicate with each other. These groups can range from the simple and practical 
     (computers in one VLAN can see the printer on that VLAN, but computers outside that VLAN cannot), to the complex 
     and legal (for example, computers in the retail banking departments cannot interact with computers in the trading departments).

Class	Ist octet Decimal Range	 Default subnet mask
  A	1 to 126	           255.0.0.0     
  B	128 to 191	         255.255.0.0
  C	192 to 223	         255.255.255.0
  D	224 to 239	
    
  The class ‘A’ Address ranging from 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 cannot be used and is reserved for loopback and diagnostic functions. 
  The numbers of hosts which can be connected to this network are greater than 65536 hosts.
  The number of hosts connected within the class B networks is from 256 to 65534 hosts.
  The number of hosts connected within the class C network is less than 254 hosts. Therefore the class C network mask is perfect for the 
  minor networks which are known as subnetworks. We utilize the bits from the last octet of class C for constructing mask. Thus we need to 
  rearrange and optimize the subnet depending upon the availability of the bits.

  Below table will show the masks that can be drawn on with Class C networks.
